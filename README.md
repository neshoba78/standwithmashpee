## &#35;StandWithMashpee Calls to Action Repo

### The Situation

On March 27, 2020 Chairman Cedric Cromwell was notified by the Department of Interior that the Secretary moved to disestablish their reservation and take it out of trust. Despite their argument of a court mandate to do so, Chairman Cromwell states that there is no such court order. This action is not only harmful to the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe but also hundreds of tribes impacted by the 2009 SCOTUS ruling Carcieri v Salazar. We need the Senate to pass H.R. 312 Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act in veto proof numbers. We further need a clean legislative fix to Carcieri v Salazar that protects the ability of all tribes to rematriate their lands through a fee-to-trust process.

The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s citizens are currently suffering a massive loss of resources and services due to the uncertainty of the trust status of the Reservation. Millions of dollars of funding are being lost or delayed for our clean water program, our children’s education through our Mukayuhsak Weekuw immersion pre-school and kindergarten and critical community service programs. It’s also a direct threat to our emergency services, housing and substance abuse program that’s desperately needed to combat the opioid epidemic. These are just a few of the ways this negative ruling is impacting our community and our children. Please consider ways that you can help correct this injustice.

### Message from the Chairman: We Will Take Action to Prevent the Loss of Our Land

March 27, 2020

At  4:00 pm today -- on the very day that the United States has reached a record 100,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and our Tribe is desperately struggling with responding to this devastating pandemic --  the Bureau of Indian Affairs informed me that the Secretary of the Interior has ordered that our reservation be disestablished and that our  land be taken out of trust.  Not since the termination era of the  mid-twentieth century has a Secretary taken action to disestablish a reservation.

Today's action was cruel and it was unnecessary. The Secretary is under no court order to take our land out of trust.  He is fully aware that litigation to uphold our status as a tribe eligible for the benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act is ongoing.

It begs the question, what is driving our federal trustee's crusade against our reservation?

Regardless of the answer, we the People of the First Light have lived here since before there was a Secretary of the Interior, since before there was a State of Massachusetts, since before the Pilgrims arrived 400 years  ago.  We have survived, we will continue to survive.  These are our lands, these are the lands of our ancestors, and these will be the lands of our grandchildren.  This Administration has come and it will go.  But we will be here, always.  And we will not rest until we are treated equally with other federally recognized tribes and the status of our reservation is confirmed.

I  will continue to provide updates on this important issue in the coming days as we take action to prevent the loss of our trust status.

Kutâputunumuw;

Chairman Cedric Cromwell
Qaqeemasq (Running Bear)
